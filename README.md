# POWL_TUTORIALS
some tutorials how to use powl and see how things work

There is a specific Report defined, which will provide all data to show 
which is filling the tutorial-table with an initial dataload. This dataload 
may change in higher versions. Additional to that it may contain some fields.
I will only use datatypes, which are available on every system. 
All kind of this is tested on a Netweaver-Stack with the following release:

SAP_BASIS	740	0008
SAP_ABA		740	0008
SAP_GWFND	740	0008
SAP_UI		740	0010
